# python-package-template

This is a template repository for projects that are Python packages.

## Getting started

After creating a new repository from this template, you need to:

1. Change the name of the `my_package` directory to the name you want.
2. Replace all mentions of `my_package` throughout this repository with the name you want.

    ```bash
    find . -type f -not -path ./.git -not -path ./README.md | xargs grep 'my_package'
    ```

3. Add repository secrets for `PYPI_USERNAME` and `PYPI_PASSWORD`.
